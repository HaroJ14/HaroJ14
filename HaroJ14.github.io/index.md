### CPSC 120

* Lab 5

    Lab 5, part 3 was one of my favroite lab, because it focused on coding for the Blackjack Score game. It felt so amazing when my lab partner and I were able to get our game to function. We were able to code what our professor wanted us to, and we appreciated that feeling of being challenged by the lab.

* Lab 6

    Lab 6 , part 2 this lab, there was a guessing game from 1 to 100, and the player may try again if they pressed the play button and indicated that they wanted to play again; otherwise, if they selected the correct answer, a message would appear to let them know.

* Lab 10

    Lab 10, part 2 I enjoyed how we were able to write something to calculate the amount of people in each county in. To compute the county's population, we had to download a file, which was new to us and challenging.
